The JAR file you just unzipped contains my solution, test scripts, and report.
I have excluded the generated test files since the request pattern generated
each time follow the same distribution. The files and directory tree are as
follows:

	/src			Java source code for my solution
	/src/www		A test web-root
	/test			Contains test scripts I used for benchmarking
	README			This file
	dzc2-prog1-report.pdf	My report
	file.txt		A test list of files
	shttp.conf		An example server configuration file
	Makefile		Make file used for building

To build my solution simply run:

	make

The Java class files will be found in the src directory.
